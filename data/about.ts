export const aboutMe = `About Me

I'm a tech enthusiast with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering, passionate about building impactful consumer applications in Web3. Over the past three years, I've been deeply involved in the blockchain space — driving developer growth, early-stage founder success, and ecosystem operations across multiple initiatives.

I work closely with early-stage developers and founders, helping them refine their ideas, structure execution plans, and move from concept to traction. I've also won multiple hackathons, with details available in my Achievements folder.

For the past two years, I've been contributing to Avalanche Team1 in India, where I've helped lead and manage several global and community initiatives — including the Mini Grant Program (grants.team1.network) and Team1 Campus (campus.team1.network).

My role extends beyond ecosystem growth — I also oversee internal operations, manage teams and budgets, and ensure effective fund allocation across multiple regional and virtual programs.

I focus on building scalable operational frameworks that keep programs efficient and sustainable, while ensuring founders and developers get the right support at the right time.

I also define content and engagement strategies — identifying what content to release, when, and how it ties into broader program goals — and ensure the success of both virtual and IRL initiatives.

My expertise spans ecosystem operations, internal process management, growth strategy, and founder enablement. I combine operational discipline with community insight — helping teams decide when to pivot, how to grow users sustainably, and how to align their product, marketing, and business strategies effectively.

In short — I build systems, guide people, and scale ecosystems.`
